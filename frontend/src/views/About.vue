      Social Distancing Scheduler is a standard to schedule your contacts and
      avoid contracting viruses like COVID-19. Built using Python, with the
      Django framework for the backend and Vue js for the frontend. SDS allows
      its users to see how many people have registered to be present at a public
      space at a given time. SDS is not a product or service it is a standard.
